For some days now, the majority of Bucharest's population has taken to the streets to oppose the decline of the nation, and the worrying economic peril. Many even called for an end to the failing regency and the kingdom as a whole, and today those revolutionary elements stormed the royal palace, and declared the Romanian Kingdom to be at an end, and the establishment of a Romanian Republic. The whereabouts of Regent Constantin Prezan and other members of his government is unknown."
