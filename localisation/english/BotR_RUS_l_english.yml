 BotR_Russian_Pre_CW_Collapse.1.t:0 "Freikorp Units Betray Boldyrev!"
 BotR_Russian_Pre_CW_Collapse.1.d:0 "With all hell breaking loose in the motherland, it was only a matter of time until chaos washed over the unruly Baltic principalities. That has been kicked off by an unexpected source - the Russo-German Legion and their leader, Franz Albert Seyn.\n\nThis morning, two divisions of the Legion occupied the city of Riga, declaring the independence of Livonia as a German state. Our government has ordered all units to surpress the uprising, but the other Freikorps units have ignored orders and have begun an active rebellion against the Governor Boldyrev. This success of the German Legion has only emboldened the calls for uprising in the Baltic states."

 BotR_Russian_Pre_CW_Collapse.2.d:0 "The General-Governorate is no more.\n\nIn the days since the Russian Civil War broke out, things have only gone downhill for Governor Boldyrev. The Freikorps betrayal was the final straw, so it seems. Spontanious uprisings in Kaunas and Revel spiraled into declarations of independence by the Lithuanians and Estonians, and the Livonian situation has only worsened. Boldyrev has finally recognized the fall of his authority, and with all of his remaining units and supporters, has fled to Petrograd to support the Tsarist government in their fight. Russian dominations of the Baltics is over."
