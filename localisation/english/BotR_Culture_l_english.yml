# FRANCE #

PB_Culture_Breton_tt_delayed:0 "To the northwest of France the last Celts in mainland Europe dwell.  After hundreds of years of forced homogeneity with the French, the Bretons gained their independence after the French surrendered and with that formed a second Breton state.  The Bretons are currently going through a cultural renaissance; with the Breton language seeing a record number of speakers and new art and literature coming from the peninsula, it seems the last mainland Celts have finally secured their existence.  However, the neo-imperialist government to their southeast has been threatening them as of late, and with French revanchism on the rise, some can’t help but think the Breton renaissance’s days are numbered."
#PB_Culture_French_tt_delayed:0 "The French people used to be considered by some as the most prestigious and romantic of Gods great children. Even the typical Anglo family would dream #that someday they would be able to travel to the city of Paris, however such feelings no longer hold true. France is seen by many as a nation with a peoples in perpetual decline. #Nothing but a European backwater. One can't blame these critics though, week after week for the last twenty or so years reports of financial crash, rising unemployment, and riots #would become almost commonplace. But change has finally gripped France, for better or worse. The regime in Paris seems to have stabilized the situation and now France and its people #are fast on track to rival both Germany and Britain. Time will tell though whether they will return to their historical status as a European Great Power, or even surpass it. "
#PB_Culture_Occitan_tt_delayed:0 "For hundreds of years, the Occitan people have suffered persecution and forced integration with their French rulers.  From the Albigensian Crusade to #the founding of France’s neo-imperialist government, the Occitans have dealt with much.  However, this has not shattered their spirit; they continue on with their long-lasting #traditions and unique Mediterranean language, keeping the Occitan torch held high amongst the darkness of French chauvinism.  They refused to be silenced, and as such provide plenty #of problems for France’s governing neo-imperialists in the form of light armed resistance and protests.  Even then, some have found shelter from the revanchists in Catalonia, Italy, #and Algeria, meaning even if the French manage to win, the Occitans will live on forever."
