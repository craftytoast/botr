 GER_WALTER_ULBRICHT_DESC:0 "§WBorn:\ June 30th, 1893\n--------------\n§!At first glance, Walter Ulbritch may seem like a new figure, as a middle-aged man situated in his 40s, it is rare to gain such a high-valued position within the republic’s administration. However, people must not be fooled by his appearance, knowing his harsh views on the preceding government and his support to the hardliners and more extreme ideals of Marxism, Ulbritch shows no remorse when it comes to achieving the goals of the state. However, unlike his mentor, Ernst Thälmann, the vice-chairman has shown support for a unified state with the use of a merger between all socialist and Marxist parties.\n\nOn the other hand, the vice-chairman also presides over the total suppression of civil and political rights within the country, which is why this controversial man can also be known as the ‘Double-Edged Eagle’.
