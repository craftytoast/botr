 ##### LEADERS #####
 FRA_napoleon_iv:0 "Louis-Napoléon IV"
 napoleon_iv_desc:0 "§WBorn:\ March 16th, 1856\n--------------\n§!If you were asked to explain the life of Louis-Napoleon IV, not one single person could properly explain all of the intrigues and experiences the aging emperor has been through, not even himself. Born the only son of Napoleon III, from birth he was the heir to the French throne. When he was 16, his father died, and he was proclaimed the Emperor of France. Much of his early reign was characterised by the young emperor, aided by the cabinet and unilateral support from the political bodies, exploiting the nations around him and strengthening the empire. Some may even recall when he brought Europe to the brink of war with the United Kingdom in the Wallonia Crisis, carving the nation of Belgium between themselves and the Dutch. He was not yet done, however, as he personally organised the Paris Conference in 1884 to set the stage for the colonisation of Africa between the colonial powers.\n\nIn 1913, well into his rule, tragedy struck when his firstborn son Jerome was assassinated in the Rhineland. Reeling from the personal devastation the loss had on him, the emperor blamed the Prussians and claimed they were behind the assassination. That was the match that lit the tense powderkeg of Europe and sent the continent spiralling into five years of bloody, hellish combat. The French-led ‘Continental Entente’ battered the storm better than the opposing forces, claiming victory at the end of 1918. With the Treaty of Koln coming into effect with the stroke of a pen, Napoleon IV finally achieved vengeance for his son.\n\nNowadays, the emperor is a spent man. His numbered days are spent at the Tuileries Palace in Paris, away from the public spotlight. It is no secret that the time he has left is finite. His two remaining sons take radically different positions on how to run the empire after their fathers death, providing the perfect storm for chaos to ensue after Napoleon’s death. The question is now, can the empire survive without him?"

 BotR_France.10.d:0 "Today, an air of uncertainty hangs over Paris.\n\nBrokers on the Bourse look on in worry. Increased economic pressures, driven by a downwards slide in the global economy, caused several minor French industrial and technical companies to file for bankrupcy this morning. That is hardly the worst of it, as rumor is the Crédit Commercial de France, the nations fifth-largest bank, is trending towards failure. The market has already dipped this morning, and with a run on the banks seemingly imminent, the long-predicted financial crisis may be upon the nation."

And slid some more. Then crashed dramatically.\n\nWith a vast wealth of captial instantly evicerated, the nation fell into a deep financial recession, with companies expected to announce mass layoffs in the coming days. Protestors, from both the left and the right, have already taken to the streets, as the government is yet to respond to the crisis."

Vaillant-Couturier has quite the history, being one of only three Communist deputies in the Chamber of Deputies between 1924 and 1932. More recently, he has been a key journalist and propaganda distributor for the Communist Party. After the crash of 1934, not only has Paul had a field day in tearing the government to shreds in a series of articles, but he has also become a key organiser and leader of the Socialist 'Unemployed Battalion' militias. Following the arrest, there have been many critizing the government for the supposed 'unlawful' arrest."

 FRA_imperial_overextension_desc:0 "When Napoleon IV led the empire on a colonisation spree throughout Africa and Asia, the reason was not driven entirely by the value these areas possess, but the prestige they brought the nation as a whole. Perhaps that’s why, year after year, the empire has to spend more that it generates from these colonies to even sustain them. Every policymaker in the empire, no matter their experience, knows that something has to change soon, lest the empire comes crumbling down not from outside aggressors, but their own failure to maintain these lands."
 FRA_eight_decades_of_bonaparte:0 "Eight Decades Of Bonaparte"
 FRA_eight_decades_of_bonaparte_desc:0 "For over eight decades, since the restoration of the Second Empire, a Bonaparte has been at the helm. No matter who you ask, unless it's a socialist or marxist, they have at least one good thing to say about the emperors. Some will applaud Napoleon III's victory over the Prussians in the early 1870s, while others will commend the current emperor Napoleon IV for his endeavours in spreading French prestige around the globe."
 FRA_the_reactionary_coalition:0 "The Reactionary Coalition - And Its Woes"
 FRA_the_reactionary_coalition_desc:0 "In the wake of the 1875 legislative elections, France found herself divided, with no clear indication of who should lead in a starkly divided Chamber of Deputies. That was when Bonapartist politician Adolphe Vuitry seized the initiative, proposing an alliance with other conservative, rightist, and monarchist clubs and parties to form the 'Réactionnaires' as they were dubbed. A loose political alliance to steal the election away from the liberals slowly solidified itself, weathering the storm to become a cornerstone of French politics.\n\nIn the years since 1875, successive coalitions of Reactionaries ruled the French government almost uninterupted, if you ignore the brief interludes of liberal tenure that occasionally occured. Their position facilitated the emperor to do pretty much anything he pleased. However, they are not the intrepid monolith they believe - and recent elections have pushed the coalition into a very narrow majority government within the chamber of deputies, relying on the benevolent aid of dissenting opposition to pass any legislation. It seems the days of total conservative dominance has been done away in France, ushering in an age of liberalism."
