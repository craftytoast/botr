 ##### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS #####
 napoleon_iv_DESC:0 "Louis-Napoleon IV, Emperor Of The French, King Of Westphalia, has lived an intricate life of royalty, luxury, war, and adventure.\n\nBorn on March 16th, 1856, to Napoleon III and Eugenie de Montijo, he was immediately designated the heir to the French throne. After his father’s passing in early 1873, he was proclaimed Emperor Napoleon IV when he was only sixteen. Much of his early reign was characterised by him and his political advisors exploiting France’s powerbase to expand the French imperial sphere. He organised the annexation of Belgium in 1879, and kicked the Italians out of Rome in the name of the Pope the next year. He focused heavily on expanding the French colonial empire in the 1880s and 90s. He personally organised the Paris Conference in 1884 to set the boundaries for the colonisation of Africa, granting him yet more diplomatic power over the world.\n\nHowever, his nation’s hegemony came into question with the beginning of the Great War in 1914, which pitted the North German Confederation, Austria-Hungary, various independent German States, and the Ottoman Empire against the French, Russians, and Dutch. The war was just barely flipped in Louis-Napoleon’s favour when a major breakthrough by Marshal Philippe Petain’s pushed French forces far into the centre of Germany, threatening to cut off German troops in Holland. After five years of nonstop war, the Germans surrendered, and out of the occupied territory Napoleon IV formed new puppet governments, all hailing in the end to him.\n\nNow, at the age of 77, the once lively Louis-Napoleon has been worn down after 60 years of rule and his old age finally catching up to him. But however, the Empire’s best doctors say he’s still got several more years in him. He vows that in these last years of life he will lead sweeping reforms to the economy, to repair the damage done by the Great Depression, and reassert the French Empire’s hegemony, once and for all."
